                        Electrifying performance meets revolutionary design and practicality. For those who want a

                        cooperation with a renowned composer, we created a distinctive sound for the ID. family: the ID
                        sound.

                        lane changes. It can also warn you and help you get back on track if you've strayed into the
                        wrong lane. If you use voice control, a light signal will respond to your voice. When you leave

                        choose. The projection on the windshield and what is happening on the asphalt seem to become a
                        single image. For additional driving comfort. Daily.

                        same way: basically no problem with a charged battery. Any of the three battery variants, with
                        different sizes, available for the ID.3 can handle such a request. You have a choice of 45 kWh,
                        58 kWh and 77 kWh batteries.

                        design, flash briefly, as if winking at you, giving the car a somewhat human character. The
                        ID.Light inside makes you feel instantly welcome. When the car starts, it makes a specific
                        little sound to get you excited to hit the road. When you leave ID.3, ID.Light will say goodbye.

                    <li>With its powerful electric performance and graceful silhouette, the new ID.5 successfully
                        represents a modern symbiosis between SUV and coupé. Over-the-Air upgradeable and ready to
                        redefine electric mobility.
                    </li>
                    <li>With a standard net battery energy content of 77 kWh (ID.5 Pro combined power consumption in
                        kWh &rarr; 100 km: xx,x; combined CO2 emissions in g&rarr;km: 0; efficiency class: A+++. ID.5
                        Pro Performance combined power consumption in kWh&rarr;100 km: xx,x; combined CO2 emissions in
                        g&rarr;km: 0; efficiency class: A+++.), the ID.5 charges so quickly (with up to 135 kW (CC)), as
                        well as smart in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>The new ID.5 can optionally shine with a feature that makes it stand out at first glance: the
                        innovative IQ.LIGHT system. The matrix technology of this system enables permanent high beam
                        driving without blinding other road users1. An elegant light strip stretches between the
                        attractively shaped matrix LED headlights and the Volkswagen logo. And what impresses at the
                        front must of course also be found at the rear: the package includes the optional 3D LED rear
                        light units with animated brake light and integrated dynamic indicator that indicates the
                        desired direction with a fluid light movement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Give your ID.5 model more personality. Choose from ten standard colors (30 colors are optional)
                        and gently illuminate the interior of the vehicle, including the dashboard, mobile phone holder
                        and doors. Cooler or warmer light - the choice is exclusively yours.
